## Introduction
Welcome to ATMeQ (ALS Identification Tool using Machine Learning and RNA-Seq), a state-of-the-art tool designed to predict Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) with unmatched precision. By combining the power of machine learning with RNA-Seq data, ATMeQ provides accurate ALS predictions based on key gene expressions.

Simply upload a .csv file containing variance-stabilized transformation (VST) data from DESeq2, and ATMeQ will apply advanced algorithms to identify the most prominent genes associated with ALS, offering reliable results in a user-friendly format. 

ATMeQ is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool with fast, precise insights, helping to drive advancements in ALS diagnosis and research.


## Motivation
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration, ultimately leading to loss of voluntary muscle control and premature mortality. Accurate and early diagnosis is paramount for facilitating timely therapeutic interventions and advancing research into effective treatment strategies.

AITeQ is dedicated to revolutionizing the diagnostic landscape of ALS by leveraging cutting-edge computational methodologies. By integrating machine learning algorithms with high-throughput RNA-Seq data analysis, our approach seeks to identify a robust and distinctive gene signature associated with ALS pathophysiology.

This integrative framework aims to empower clinicians and researchers with precise molecular insights, enabling early detection and enhancing understanding of the disease's complex molecular mechanisms. AITeQ strives to bridge the gap between bioinformatics innovations and clinical applications, driving progress toward improved diagnostic precision and patient outcomes
